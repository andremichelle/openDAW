# 🎹 The Timeline
Where music happens in time.

## 🏗️ Structure
The timeline is stacked in layers:
1.  **Header**: Time ruler and markers.
2.  **Clips**: Audio and MIDI regions.
3.  **Automation**: Curves for parameters.

## 📍 Navigation Tools
*   **Follow Cursor**: The timeline will auto-scroll to keep the playhead in view during playback.
*   **Snapping**: Controls how clips align to the grid (measures/beats). This is usually toggled in the sub-header.

## 🔴 Visual Feedback
When **Recording** or **Counting In**, the timeline background will flash or specific styling will activate to warn you that you are "Hot".
