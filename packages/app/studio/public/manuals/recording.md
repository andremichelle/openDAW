# openDAW Recording

## Capturing Devices

openDAW allows you to capture and record audio and MIDI. To arm an audio-unit (essentially your instrument), please use
the tiny record button in the timeline track-header. You can arm as many audio-units as you like by holding the
shift-key. By using the hamburger menu (Capture Media), you can filter on different devices and channels.

## Recording

After arming as many tracks as you like, you can record by pressing the record button in the transport controls.

## Current State of Development

* Recording does not respect loops

## Tips

* Make sure you have low output latency. This can be read in the studio's footer.
