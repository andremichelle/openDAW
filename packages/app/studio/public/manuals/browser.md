# 📂 The Browser
Your sonic palette. The browser is split into three dedicated modes:

## 1. 🎛️ Devices
Your plugin arsenal.
*   **Instruments**: Synths, Samplers, Generators.
*   **Effects**: EQ, Compression, Reverb.
*   **Utilities**: MIDI tools and processors.

## 2. 🌊 Samples
Your audio files.
*   Drag and drop these directly onto the **Timeline** or into a **Sampler** device.

## 3. 🎹 Soundfonts
A library of classic sample-based instruments (SF2 format). Great for quick sketching.
