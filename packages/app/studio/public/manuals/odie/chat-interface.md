# 💬 The Chat Configuration

> **Goal**: Master the "Conversation" with your DAW.
> **Prerequisites**: Odie Connected (See Quickstart)

Odie's sidebar is not just a text log—it is a live monitor of your session's context.

## 📘 1. Concepts: Context Bubbles

When you chat with Odie, you aren't just sending text. Odie "sees" a snapshot of your current focus. This is called a **Context Bubble**.

*   **Active Selection**: If a Clip is selected, "Delete" means "Delete Clip", not "Delete Track".
*   **Active Panel**: If the Mixer is open, "Make it brighter" implies EQ, not Arrangement.
*   **Transport State**: If playing, Odie knows the BPM and Time Signature.

**Pro Tip**: Always select what you want to talk about *before* sending the message.
