# 🤖 Welcome to Odie (Alpha)

Odie is the first **Generative Engine** fully integrated into the OpenDAW nervous system. It is not just a chatbot; it is a **Reasoning Co-Pilot** that can see your project, understand your artistic intent, and manipulate the studio directly.

## 📘 The "Hands, Brain, Eyes" Model

Odie operates on a three-tier model to assist your workflow:

1.  **EYES (Context Awareness)**: Odie monitors your session—track selection, plugin chains, and mixer states. It knows what you are working on.
2.  **BRAIN (Reasoning Engine)**: Powered by **Gemini 3**, Odie understands music theory, genre conventions, and DAW technicalities.
3.  **HANDS (Verified App Control)**: Odie can add tracks, load instruments, set BPM, and tweak mixer parameters via high-level commands.

## 🎨 Molecular Knowledge

Unlike standard AI, Odie is grounded in **Molecular Knowledge**. It has been trained on the "OpenDAW Bible," ensuring it uses precise terminology and valid DAW operations. When you ask it to "Add a Sub-Bass," it knows exactly which plugin and settings provide the best foundation for your currently selected genre.
