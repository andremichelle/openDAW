# Cloud Backup

openDAW supports storing your projects in **Google Drive** and **Dropbox**.  
Both services require a one-time **OAuth login**. OAuth is the official login method provided by many cloud services. It
means:

- You log in directly on the provider’s website
- openDAW receives a secure access token from them
- openDAW never sees your password
- No personal data or assets are stored on openDAW servers — everything stays in your own cloud account
