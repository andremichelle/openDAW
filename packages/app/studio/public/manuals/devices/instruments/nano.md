## 0. Overview

_Nano_ is designed for simplicity. Load any audio file, and it becomes a playable instrument mapped across all MIDI notes. The sample is pitch-shifted to match the played note.

Example uses:

- Quick chromatic sampling of any sound
- Simple melodic instruments from single samples
- Sound design experimentation
- Placeholder instruments during composition
