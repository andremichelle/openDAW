# OpenDAW Odie Project Status

## 🚀 Alpha Milestone: Intelligence & Grounding

### Foundation (Phase 1)
- [x] Align Odie with OpenDAW nomenclature (BPM vs Tempo, Soundfont vs Instrument)
- [x] Implement AI thinking model support (Thoughts panel integration)
- [x] Verify state hydration for History and Settings
- [x] Refactor Sidebar for responsive layout consistency

### Persona & Knowledge (Phase 2)
- [x] Implement "Discovery First" protocol in persona instructions
- [x] Add authoritative device knowledge for all native instruments/effects
- [x] Implement strict "No Hallucination" brand guards

### Comprehensive Testing Sprint (Phase 3)
- [x] Implement Tool Parity Audit test
- [x] Implement Workflow Comprehension scenario test
- [x] Run full test suite and verify 100% pass rate
- [x] Finalize walkthrough with test evidence

### Resilience & Safety (Phase 4)
- [x] Implement Network Fault Injection (404/500 simulation)
- [x] Implement Defensive API Benchmarks (Malformed Inputs)
- [x] Verify Transaction Integrity during rapid tool sequences
- [x] Finalize Phase 4 Validation report

### Generative Verification (Phase 5)
- [x] Implement "The C-Major Scale Test" (verify `addMidiNotes` creates clips)
- [x] Audit `NoteRegionBox` creation logic in mock environment
- [x] Validate Output Integrity (ensure notes are actually added to track)

## 🎯 Current Status
Odie is now fully grounded in OpenDAW's engine with a mathematically verified tool registry and musical common sense patterns.

**Next Milestone:** Beta - Multi-track generative sequencing.
