# TODO

## Bugs

## Next

* Refactor MIDI learning for the new capture system
* Fully implement capture
    * List all devices
    * If MIDI, select all channels or specific channel
    * If Audio, let the user select the number of channels (max and default is 2)
* Implement monitor
    * ~~If audio, show peak-meter~~ and allow monitoring

## Level #1

* Stop (start) recording at quantized positions
* Inform the user if there is no outputLatency (Chrome only)
* Find a way to overlay, replace, mix on existing regions
* Find a way to handle loops/jumps while recording
* Audio editor
* Respect zero-crossing
* Handle external changes to the project (deletion of audio-units, tracks, regions, etc. while recording)

## Done

* ~~If tracks, use the first available audio-unit to record~~
* ~~If the project is empty, ask if the user wants to record audio or midi~~
* ~~Play global transport when starting a clip~~
* ~~Severe bug in undo~~
* ~~Store capture filters in boxes~~
* ~~Template "Liquid" and "Release" timing issue because of CaptureManager~~
* ~~We need a flag to identify audio-unit's main content (audio or MIDI)~~
* ~~Generate peaks while recording~~
* ~~Store samples in OPFS (to upload later into the cloud)~~
* ~~Shift + Record to suppress count-in~~
* ~~Recording-gain~~

## Level #2

* Record samples into Playfield and clips
* Better audio playback algorithms
    * time-stretch
    * event-based warping
* Allow recording from other audio-units (baking)
