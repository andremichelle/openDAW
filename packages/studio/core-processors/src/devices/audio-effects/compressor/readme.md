# CTAGDRC Compressor - TypeScript Port

## Attribution

This is a TypeScript port of the CTAG Dynamic Range Compressor (CTAGDRC), originally created by Phillip Lamp.

**Original Project:**
- Name: CTAGDRC (CTAG Dynamic Range Compressor)

**LookAhead Implementation:**
The lookahead implementation is based on work by Daniel Rudrich:

## Description

This TypeScript implementation faithfully ports the DSP (Digital Signal Processing) algorithms from the original C++/JUCE implementation to work in a web audio context. The compressor implements a feedforward VCA-style topology based on research papers on digital dynamic range compression.

### Key Features Ported:
- **Gain Computer**: Calculates compression curve with threshold, ratio, and soft knee
- **Level Detector (Ballistics)**: Smooth branched peak detector for attack/release timing
- **Crest Factor Analysis**: Automatic attack/release adjustment based on signal characteristics
- **LookAhead Limiting**: Anticipates peaks and fades in gain reduction to prevent distortion
- **Auto Makeup Gain**: Time-varying makeup gain based on average attenuation
- **Parallel Compression**: Dry/wet mix control

## Modifications

This TypeScript port includes the following adaptations:
- Conversion from C++ to TypeScript
- Adaptation to work with TypeScript/JavaScript typed arrays instead of JUCE AudioBuffer
- Integration with a web-based audio processing architecture
- Use of TypeScript private fields (#) and readonly keywords

The core DSP algorithms remain faithful to the original implementation.
