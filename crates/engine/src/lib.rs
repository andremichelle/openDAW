//! The WASM audio-engine module: a downstream `BoxGraph` mirror fed the live FORWARD-only sync
//! stream (`SyncSource` -> worklet/test bridge). JS copies the serialized `UpdateTask[]` into the
//! input buffer, calls `apply_updates(len)`, then reads the 32-byte checksum buffer to compare
//! against the TS source after every transaction.
//!
//! All engine state lives in one `Engine` struct held in a single `Shared` cell (an `UnsafeCell`
//! asserted `Sync` for this single-threaded module), plus the four fixed I/O buffers JS reaches by
//! pointer. The `extern "C"` exports are thin wrappers that call into the `Engine`; its methods are
//! ordinary safe Rust on `&mut self`. Box-graph subscriptions never touch the `Engine` — doing so
//! would alias the `&mut self` a transaction already holds — so they record scalar edits into a
//! shared `Controls` of `Cell`s that `render` applies (mirroring how the value/note collections keep
//! their own `Rc<RefCell<..>>` state off the engine).
//!
//! ALLOCATOR: talc (`WasmDynamicTalc`), a reclaiming allocator that grows linear memory via
//! `memory.grow` on demand and frees blocks back for reuse. Single-threaded build, so no lock.
